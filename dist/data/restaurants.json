Service is always good, can be a little slow but I guess that adds to you relaxing and removing some of that daily bustle."

The servers provide some of the best service I've ever had in a restaurant.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."

Food is always fresh, best salads I have had in Trinidad and it is the most peaceful relaxing restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere! A hidden gem, an oasis in a busy city! Just fabulous!"
